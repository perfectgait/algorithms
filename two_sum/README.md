# 2-SUM

## Problems
### Question 1
The goal of this problem is to implement a variant of the 2-SUM algorithm.

The file contains 1 million integers, both positive and negative (there might be some repetitions!).This is your array
of integers, with the ith row of the file specifying the ith entry of the array.

Your task is to compute the number of target values t in the interval -10000,10000 (inclusive) such that there are
distinct numbers x,y in the input file that satisfy x+y=t.

# Algorithms
## Programming assignments for Coursera course [Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1](https://class.coursera.org/algo-007)

These assignments were all done using Python.  This is my first real dive into Python so please be gentle. :)
The following algorithms are covered:

* Quick sort
* Merge sort
* Karger's randomized contraction
* Dijkstra's shortest-path
